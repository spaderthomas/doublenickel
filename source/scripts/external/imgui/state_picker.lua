	I guess this is as good of a place as any to put this. The layout code for a lot of the editor
	(e.g. how wide should this combo box be?) is very naive. In a lot of cases, and in particular
	the UI for picking rolls and conditions and lists thereof, we just hardcode widths.

	I'm sure it's possible to do this in a smarter way, but it pretty much works for me and only
	looks wrong in a few places.

	The default width of 250 is tuned for UI where you have [state] [op] [value] [X]. We want that
	to be large enough so you can see the state field, but not so large that the side menu has to be
	very wide, which eats into the game view / dialogue editor view. In fact, the editor is *highly*
	tuned to this 250 value; the default layout's left side panel is sized so that the aforementioned
	piece of UI fits *exactly*.

	That's why this function takes this stupid parameter; so that in other places (e.g. a Set node's
	detail UI), we can use full width, but in space-conscious places, we use a sane default. Zero width
	means to fill the region.
